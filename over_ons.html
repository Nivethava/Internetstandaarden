            <p>Heyyy guys, my name is Aminata, one of the co-host in our Podcast. I'm a huge fan of true crime and love finding out different twisted stories. Also I'm nothing related to true crime so I'm just a big fan!!! When I'm not working you can find me watching the latest documentaries or books about true crime. True crime just fascinates me, the unsolved mysteries and stories. I hope you will like our Podcastüå∂Ô∏è.</p>
