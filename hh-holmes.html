        <p>H.H. Holmes, born Herman Webster Mudgett in 1861, is often regarded as one of America’s first known serial killers. He was a notorious con artist and murderer who operated during the late 19th century.

           <p>The Hotel ("Murder Castle")
            Holmes' most famous hotel, the ‘Murder Castle’. That was his playground where he fully indulged his twisted thoughts. Every visitor who entered never came out again, unfortunately. The "Murder Castle" was a labyrinth of hidden rooms, secret passageways, soundproof chambers, and trapdoors, making it an ideal location for committing his crimes. In addition to the secret rooms, he had a basement where he experimented on his victims. After killing them, he sold their skeletons to medical schools to earn some money. However, where he made most of his money was through insurance fraud. Holmes confessed to 27 murders, but it's said that the number of victims he killed exceeds over 200 murders. In 1894, he was arrested, and in 1896, he was executed by hanging. He remains one of the most gruesome serial killers in American history.
